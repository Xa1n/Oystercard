## Oystercard Challenge

This project is an attempt at creating a software replica of the Oyster card system that London's TFL uses for its transport.
This system should allow a user to use an Oyster in London's stations, as long as the Oyster has a sufficient balance (which requires topping
up), and after each tap, records a journey whether it is tapped out or not. 


## Setup

Clone and pull this onto your local repo. Cd to the directory 'Oystercard' in your terminal, open up irb and require './lib/oystercard' to test the features.
